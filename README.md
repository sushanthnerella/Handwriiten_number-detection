MNIST Dataset Classification with Neural Networks
  Overview
      This project aims to classify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset using neural networks. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of 
      handwritten digits (0 through 9), along with their corresponding labels.
  Dependencies
      Python 3.x
      TensorFlow
      NumPy 
      Matplotlib 
  
Dataset
    The MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. It is commonly used as a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. The 
     dataset is provided in a preprocessed format, making it easy to load and use for training neural networks.
Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow library. The following steps outline the process:

   Data Loading: Load the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow's built-in functions.
   Data Preprocessing: Normalize the pixel values to be in the range [0, 1] and reshape the images to the appropriate format for the neural network.
   Model Definition: Define a neural network architecture for classification. This can range from a simple feedforward network to more complex convolutional neural networks 
    (CNNs).
   Model Training: Train the neural network using the training dataset. This involves feeding the input images through the network, computing the loss, and optimizing the 
    network parameters using gradient descent.
   Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated.
    Results Visualization: Visualize the performance of the model using plots or confusion matrices.
 Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately  97%on the test dataset. Further details about the model's performance can be found in the results directory.
